This package contains a port of the cmu snmp v2.1.2.1 package for
hp-ux 700 series 9.0.5 OS computers.  Note that version 2.1.2.1 did
NOT work out of the box.  I had to hack snmplib/parse.c to get it to
correctly read the mib.txt file without seg-faulting.  Having now
looked at the code in parse.c, I fail to see how it worked under
2.1.2.  Actually, it would probably work fine providing you either had
a zero length mib.txt file and/or had no DESCRIPTION fields in it.
Below is my short change log:

    Initial CMU snmp code, version 2.1.2

hardaker 14 Dec 94 16:55:13
    HP-UX port of the CMU code

hardaker 14 Dec 94 17:02:37
    Added hpux.c (random/srandom interfaces)

    New release of CMU's 2.1.2.1 code:
      -- See README for specific details
      -- snmpset,snmpgetnext added
      -- -q flag added "quick print"
      -- bug fixes
      -- Man pages updated

    CMU 2.1.2 -> 2.1.2.1 Merge.

hardaker 10 Mar 95 13:19:22
    #include <socketio.h> is not needed on HPUX

hardaker 10 Mar 95 13:30:21
  Major hacking to parse() to work at all.
    -- Now I don't unstand why it ever successfully parsed the mib.txt file.
    -- get_token was constantly called to read DESCRIPTION strings into
       a char array of either 64 (MAXTOKEN) or 4096 (MAXQUOTESTR) in
       length.  MANY of the DESCRIPTION strings are longer than this.
    -- Hacked parseQuotedString to make sure returned are strings < MAXQUOTESTR

hardaker 10 Mar 95 13:34:30
    Added /etc as another path to search when looking for mib.txt

hardaker 13 Mar 95 16:20:58
    2.1.2.1 port to hp-ux.

I personally use a modified version of this code with limited
extensibility supported, which I will release if enough people bug me
and once it evolves into a more usable form.

I know it compiles and works, but I haven't quiet tested everything.
If you find something which breaks, you can either fix it and send me
a patch or tell me and I'll attempt to fix it myself.
