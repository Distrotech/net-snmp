This file contains major changes in released revisions.  Please read
the ChangeLog file for a more detailed listing of changes/bug fixes.

*3.3.1*

 New:
    - "make install" installs the library and header files.

 Fixes:
    - compilation on many architectures (sunos for example).
    - snmptrapd doesn't exit if v2party files don't exist.
    - host resources works a bit better (ie, it compiles) under solaris.
    

*3.3*

  Path changes:
    - the default paths to the installed mibs and snmpd.conf file have
      changed to /usr/local/share/snmp (set differently using --datadir).
    - the default path of the snmpd and snmptrapd have changed to
      /usr/local/sbin (set differently using --sbindir).

  New:
    - basic SNMPV2c support.  
      - Not fully tested (feedback please!), and not RFC compliant.
      - all apps require '-v 2c' for v2c and '-v 2p' for the older party code.
    - basic host-resources mib support for linux, and hpux.
    - All environment variables can be set with a preceding '+' for
        indicating additions to the default values.
    - mib modules cleaned up more and can be added and removed more easily.
    - mib modules have a new macro for callbacks when reading a .conf file.
    - apps command line interfaces have merged together for standardization.
    - the libsnmp library no longer forces printing of errors.
    - 2 new applications: snmpdelta and snmptable.
    - the mib parser caches mib directory scans for speed improvements.
    - snmptrapd is snmp-version multi-lingual.

  Ported:
    - irix should be more complete.
    - aix 4.1.5.
    - fixes for hpux 10.20.
    - linux 2.1.x support.
    - library and apps supported under 32bit windows systems.

  Fixes:
    - too numerous to mention.

*3.2*

  New:
    - Top level of the mib parser has been restructured
      - no longer reads 'mib.txt'
      - no longer reads everything (MIBS/MIBDIRS)
      - reads import clauses to load other required modules
      - new man page: mib_api.3
    - The agent has been completely restructured (modularized) to
      allow for easier extension via C code and requires no
      modification of the ucd-snmp distributed source code to add in
      new C coded mib modules.  See the README file in the
      agent/mibgroup subdirectory for details.  Modules are added and/or
      removed via configure options.
    - agent can send traps to multiple trap destinations.
    - configure can be run outside the default source directory.
    - Optional modules:  SMUX support to talk with a running gated.

    - code is now prototyped and many related bugs have been found.
      (an ANSI compiler is still optional.)
    - Many others.

  Ported:
    - linux-2.*
    - mips-sgi-irix6.3  (agent needs 2 mib-modules removed still)

    - snmpV1 community names can be set in the configuration files now!
    - new app:  apps/snmptrap, as requested by many, many people.
    - New man page (rough still):  snmpd.conf.5.

*3.0.5*

  Bug fixes:

  Mainly a bug fix release:
    - fixed another 32/64 bit problem:  returned exit codes on alphas
      were incorrect.
    - many system errors (e.g., no mem) were causing the agent to
      return error flags when it really was clueless.  
    - found a memory leak in the CMU routing table implementation.
    - More configure cleanups, mostly for Solaris.
    - snmp_open calls getservbyname only once now, at the request of Gary
      Hayward <gah@dirac.bellcore.com>.  Mainly for Perl users.

  New example file:  EXAMPLE.conf file (created at build time).

  local/snmpcheck has drastically improved, and now requires Tk-b8.

  You can now mung with all sorts of numbers in config.h and the
  mib.txt file will be mostly built from it if you change my defaults.

      .configure's --prefix location

  Now using GNU's auto-conf for better portability
