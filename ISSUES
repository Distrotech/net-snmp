# This file contains a list of issues and ownership of those issues.  It
# is meant to be a convenient but trivial method of logging work that
# people are doing so as to avoid conflict when possible as well as
# logging thoughts/errors/yet-to-be-done-features before they are
# forgotten about.  This file should be committed _immediately_ after you
# modify it.
# 
# Format:
#   SYMBOL USER/DATE : USER/DATE/DATE
#       DESCRIPTION
# 
# Where the first USER/DATE pair is the date it was created in this
# file, and the second USER/DATE/DATE is the person working on the issue 
# and the date began and the date finished.
#
# Symbols:
#
# * Needed by next release/demo                 (oct)
# + Needed by the following release/demo        (feb)
# - Needed at some point later                  (phase II)
# . Completed

# (a given symbol doesn't mean that they can't be completed earlier...
# They are a deadline indicator)

    snmplib/snmpusm.c: snmp_clone_user() should be split into two
    functions, namely snmp_create_new_user() and snmp_clone_user().

* hardaker/Sep 23 : hardaker/Sep 23
    snmplib/snmpusm.c: snmp_clone_user() shouldn't clone the name and
    engineid when cloneFrom is set?

+ hardaker/Sep 23
    Is creation of users via sets to something other than the
    usmUserStatus object going to be allowed?  For the time being, for
    ease of implementation, the status column *must* be set first.  This
    might need to change later if we so decide.

+ hardaker/Sep 23
    usmUserSpinLock needs to be done better and to return an error asap,
    rather than at commit.  Undo should undo the set as well.

+ hardaker/Sep 23
    Actually, the usm code should be careful about backing out of a set
    (currently at COMMIT, it happens regardless of past or future fails).

* hardaker/Sep 23
    The EngineBoots incrementer needs to be reset upon a engineID change.

+ hardaker/Sep 23
    When cloning, what do we do when a malloc fails in mid stream?  Do 
    we need to revert all the back to the pre-attempt version of the
    user?  Probably, and this needs to be fixed in snmpusm.c.

+ hardaker/Sep 23
    usmUser.c: check all user->statusUserStorageType before modifying
    a user that can't be saved later.

+ hardaker/Sep 23
    general question:  notReady can never be set as a RowStatus, but
    what error is the proper error to return if someone tries?

- hardaker/Sep 27
    currently the persistent cache assumes name and secName don't have 
    NULLs in them.

+ hardaker/Sep 27
    usmUser parsing will fill the structure if parsed twice.  The free 
    routine in the config_handler needs to be created.

+ hardaker/Sep 29
    Correctly map error codes from mib modules from v2/v3 errors to v1.
