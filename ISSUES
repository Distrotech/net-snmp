# This file contains a list of issues and ownership of those issues.  It
# is meant to be a convenient but trivial method of logging work that
# people are doing so as to avoid conflict when possible as well as
# logging thoughts/errors/yet-to-be-done-features before they are
# forgotten about.  This file should be committed _immediately_ after you
# modify it.

# Format:
#   SYMBOL USER/DATE : USER/DATE/DATE
#       DESCRIPTION
# 
# Where the first USER/DATE pair is the date it was created in this
# file, and the second USER/DATE/DATE is the person working on the issue 
# and the date began and the date finished.

# Symbols:

# * Needed by next release/demo                 (oct)
# + Needed by the following release/demo        (feb)
# - Needed at some point later                  (phase II)

# (a given symbol doesn't mean that they can't be completed earlier...
# They are a deadline indicator)

    snmplib/snmpusm.c: snmp_clone_user() should be split into two
    functions, namely snmp_create_new_user() and snmp_clone_user().

* hardaker/Sep 23 : hardaker/Sep 23
    snmplib/snmpusm.c: snmp_clone_user() shouldn't clone the name and
    engineid when cloneFrom is set?

+ hardaker/Sep 23
    Is creation of users via sets to something other than the
    usmUserStatus object going to be allowed?  For the time being, for
    ease of implementation, the status column *must* be set first.  This
    might need to change later if we so decide.

+ hardaker/Sep 23
    usmUserSpinLock needs to be done better and to return an error asap,
    rather than at commit.  Undo should undo the set as well.

+ hardaker/Sep 23
    Actually, the usm code should be careful about backing out of a set
    (currently at COMMIT, it happens regardless of past or future fails).
