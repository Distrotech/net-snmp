It\r\n  has been greatly modified, restructured, enhanced and fixed.  It\r\n  hardly looks the same as anything that CMU has ever released.  It\r\n  was renamed from cmu-snmp to ucd-snmp in 1995 and later renamed from\r\n  ucd-snmp to net-snmp in November 2000.\r\n\r\n  This README file serves as a starting place to learn about the\r\n  package, but very little of the documentation is contained within\r\n  this file.  The FAQ is an excellent place to start as well.\r\n  Additionally, there are a bunch of README files for specific\r\n  architectures and specific features.  You might wish to look at some\r\n  of these other files as well.\r\n\r\nSUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES\r\n\r\n  Please see the FAQ for this information.\r\n\r\n  Please let us know if you compile it on other OS versions and it\r\n  works for you so we can add them to the above list.\r\n\r\n  Porting:  Please! read the PORTING file.\r\n\r\n  Also note that many architecture have architecture specific README\r\n  files, so you should check to see if there is one appropriate to\r\n  your platform.\r\n\r\nAVAILABILITY\r\n\r\n  Download:\r\n    - http://www.net-snmp.org/download/\r\n    - ftp://ftp.net-snmp.org/pub/sourceforge/net-snmp/\r\n  Web page:\r\n    - http://www.net-snmp.org/\r\n  Project Wiki:\r\n    - http://www.net-snmp.org/wiki/\r\n  Sourceforge Project page:\r\n    - http://sourceforge.net/projects/net-snmp\r\n  Mirrors:\r\n    - US:        ftp://ftp.freesnmp.com/mirrors/net-snmp/\r\n\r\n  The old ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu web site and ftp server is now\r\n  offline and should not be accessed any longer.\r\n\r\nWEB PAGES\r\n\r\n  http://www.net-snmp.org/\r\n  http://sourceforge.net/projects/net-snmp\r\n  http://www.net-snmp.org/wiki/\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\n  See the INSTALL file distributed with this package.\r\n\r\nCOPYING AND COPYRIGHTS\r\n\r\n  See the COPYING file distributed with this package.\r\n\r\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\r\n\r\n  See the FAQ file distributed with this package.\r\n  This is also available on the project Wiki at\r\n\r\n     http://www.net-snmp.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ\r\n\r\n  so that the wider Net-SNMP community can help maintain it!\r\n\r\nHELPING OUT\r\n\r\n  This is a project worked on by people around the net.  We'd love\r\n  your help, but please read the PORTING file first.  Also, subscribe\r\n  to the net-snmp-coders list described below and mention what you're\r\n  going to work on to make sure no one else is already doing so!\r\n  You'll also need to keep up to date with the latest code snap shot,\r\n  which can be obtained from CVS using the information found at\r\n  http://www.net-snmp.org/cvs/.\r\n\r\n  Contributions to the Net-SNMP source code in any form are greatly\r\n  appreciated.  We expect the parties providing such contributions to\r\n  have the right to contribute them to the Net-SNMP project or that\r\n  the parties that do have the right have directed the person\r\n  submitting the contribution to do so.  In addition, all contributors\r\n  need to be aware that if the contribution is accepted and\r\n  incorporated into the Net-SNMP project, it will be redistributed\r\n  under the terms of the license agreement used for the entire body of\r\n  work that comprises the Net-SNMP project (see the COPYING file for\r\n  details).  If this license agreement ever changes the contribution\r\n  will continue to be released under any new licenses as well.  Thank\r\n  you, in advance, for your gracious contributions.\r\n\r\nCODE UPDATE ANNOUNCEMENTS\r\n\r\n  See the NEWS file and the ChangeLog file for details on what has\r\n  changed between releases.\r\n\r\n  We hate broadcasting announce messages to other mailing lists and\r\n  newsgroups, so there is a mailing list set up to handle release\r\n  announcements.  Any time we put new software out for ftp, we'll mail\r\n  this fact to net-snmp-announce@lists.sourceforge.net.  See the\r\n  MAILING LISTS section described below to sign up for these\r\n  announcements.\r\n\r\n  We will post new announcements on a very infrequent basis to the\r\n  other channels (the other snmp mailing lists and newsgroups like\r\n  comp.protocols.snmp), but only for major code revisions and not for\r\n  bug-fix patches or small feature upgrades.\r\n\r\nMAILING LISTS\r\n\r\n  The lists:\r\n\r\n    A number of mailing lists have been created for support of the project:\r\n    The main ones are:\r\n\r\n      net-snmp-announce@lists.sourceforge.net  -- For official announcements\r\n      net-snmp-users@lists.sourceforge.net     -- For usage discussions\r\n      net-snmp-coders@lists.sourceforge.net    -- For development discussions\r\n\r\n    The -coders list is intended for discussion on development of code\r\n    that will be shipped as part of the package.  The -users list is\r\n    for general discussion on configuring and using the package,\r\n    including issues with coding user-developed applications (clients,\r\n    managers, MIB modules, etc).\r\n\r\n    Please do *NOT* send messages to both -users and -coders lists.\r\n    This is completely unnecessary, and simply serves to further\r\n    overload (and annoy) the core development team.   If in doubt,\r\n    just use the -users list.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The other lists of possible interest are:\r\n\r\n      net-snmp-cvs@lists.sourceforge.net       -- For cvs update announcements\r\n      net-snmp-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net      -- For Bug database update announcements\r\n      net-snmp-patches@lists.sourceforge.net   -- For Patch database update announcements\r\n\r\n    Please do NOT post messages to these lists (or to the announce list above).\r\n    Bug reports and Patches should be submitted via the Source Forge tracker\r\n    system.  See the main project web pages for details.\r\n\r\n    To subscribe to any of these lists, please see:\r\n  \r\n      http://www.net-snmp.org/lists/\r\n\r\n\r\n  Archives:\r\n    The archives for these mailing lists can be found by following links at\r\n\r\n      http://www.net-snmp.org/lists/\r\n\r\nAGENT EXTENSIBILITY\r\n\r\n  The agent that comes with this package is extensible through use of\r\n  shell scripts and other methods.  See the configuration manual pages\r\n  (like snmpd.conf) and run the snmpconf perl script for further details.\r\n\r\n  You can also extend the agent by writing C code directly.  The agent\r\n  is extremely modular in nature and you need only create new files,\r\n  re-run configure and re-compile (or link against its libraries).  No\r\n  modification of the distributed source files are necessary.  See the\r\n  following files for details on how to go about this:\r\n  http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial-5/toolkit/,\r\n  agent/mibgroup/examples/*.c\r\n\r\n  Also, see the local/mib2c program and its README file for help in\r\n  turning a textual mib description into a C code template.\r\n\r\n  We now support AgentX for subagent extensibility.  The net-snmp\r\n  agent can run as both a master agent and a subagent.  Additionally,\r\n  a toolkit is provided that enables users of it to easily embed a\r\n  agentx client into external applications.  See the tutorial at\r\n  http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial-5/toolkit/ for an example of how\r\n  go about doing this.\r\n\r\nCONFIGURATION\r\n\r\n  See the man/snmp.conf.5 manual page.\r\n\r\n  For the agent, additionally see the man/snmpd.conf.5 manual page.\r\n\r\n  For the snmptrapd, see the man/snmptrapd.conf.5 manual page.\r\n\r\n  You can also run the snmpconf perl script to help you create some of\r\n  these files.\r\n\r\nSUBMITTING BUG REPORTS\r\n\r\n  Important: *Please* include what version of the net-snmp (or\r\n  ucd-snmp) package you are using and what architecture(s) you're\r\n  using, as well as detailed information about exactly what is wrong.\r\n\r\n  To submit a bug report, please use the web interface at\r\n  http://www.net-snmp.org/bugs/.  It is a full-fledged\r\n  bug-tracking system that will allow you to search for already\r\n  existing bug reports as well as track the status of your report as\r\n  it is processed by the core developers.\r\n\r\n  If you intend to submit a patch as well, please read the PORTING\r\n  file before you do so and then submit it to\r\n  http://www.net-snmp.org/patches/.\r\n\r\nCLOSING\r\n\r\n  We love patches.  Send some to us!  But before you do, please see\r\n  the 'PORTING' file for information on helping us out with the\r\n  process of integrating your patches (regardless of whether its a new\r\n  feature implementation or a new port).\r\n\r\n  Also, We're interested if anyone actually uses/likes/hates/whatever\r\n  this package...  Mail us a note and let us know what you think of it!\r\n\r\n  Have fun and may it make your life easier,\r\n\r\n    The net-snmp developers\r\n\r\nTHANKS\r\n\r\n  The following people have contributed various patches and\r\n  improvements.
