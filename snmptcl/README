This is a port of Poul-Henning Kamp's excellent TCL SNMP package
(originally for CMU SNMP 1) to CMU SNMP 2.  This should be regarded
as a prototype as the TCL API for the CMU SNMP distribution will
probably change remarkably.

To compile your own version of TCL, you need to pick up TCL and TK
separately from sprite.berkeley.edu.  Remember to edit the Imakefile
in this directory with the correct pathnames for your system and then
run xmkmf (imake).

If you want to experiment without building your own version of the
command interpreter, wish, a copy is available on
lancaster.andrew.cmu.edu in the pub/snmp-dist directory.  The
snmpgraph application in this directory will work with this (make sure
wish is in your path).  snmpgraph.ps can be printed to see what the
application looks like.

In any case, you need to put wish in your path and provide some
libraries to the wish executable in a well known place.  Create the
following links:
ln -s $SNMPROOT/tk /usr/lib/tk
ln -s $SNMPROOT/tcl /usr/lib/tcl
(Without this, you will get errors complaining that certain files
can't be found).

For snmpgraph, try:

snmpgraph -v 1 hostname 5 interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifInOctets.1

Dragging the left mouse button zooms.
Dragging the right mouse button moves the legend.
Pressing pause pauses screen updates (data is still being polled).
Press pause again to update.
Pressing the top right button takes the dataset off the screen
(intended for plotting multiple variables).
Pressing "p" creates a postscript image of the window named snmpgraph.ps.
Pressing "^C" exits.
