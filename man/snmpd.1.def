.RS
.TP 6
.B DATADIR/snmp/snmpd.conf
.TP
.B DATADIR/snmp/snmpd.local.conf
Configures the agent.  See snmpd.conf(5) for details.  These files are
optional and are only used to configure the extensible portions of the
agent, the values of the community strings, and the optional trap
destinations.  By default, the first community string ("public" by
default) is allowed read-only access and the second ("private" by
default) is allowed write access as well.  The 3-5th community strings
are read-only as well.
.IP
In addition to these two configuration files in DATADIR/snmp, the
agent will read any files with the names snmpd.conf and
snmpd.local.conf in a colon separated path specified in the
SNMPCONFPATH environmental variable.
.TP
.B DATADIR/snmp/mibs/
The agent will also load all files in this directory as mibs also.  It
will not, however, load any file that begins with a '.' or decend into
subdirectories.
