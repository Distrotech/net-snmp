.SH NAME
snmpget - communicates with a network entity using SNMP GET Requests.
.SH SYNOPSIS
snmpget -v 1 hostname community objectID [objectID]...
.PP
snmpget [-v 2] hostname noAuth objectID [objectID]...
.PP
snmpget\ [-v\ 2] hostname srcParty dstParty objectID [objectID]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Snmpget is an SNMP application that uses the GET Request to query for
information on a network entity.  One or more fully qualified object
identifiers may be given as arguments on the command line.
Each variable name is given in the format specified in
.IR variables (5).
.PP
The
.I hostname
specification may be either a host name or an internet address
specified in "dot notation".
.PP
The version 1
.I community
specifies the community name for the transaction with the remote system.
.PP
The version 2
.I srcParty
and
.I dstParty
specify the party names for the transaction with the remote system, as
they are defined in /etc/party.conf.  To forgo authentication, use the
.B noAuth
keyword instead of specifying party names.
.PP
For example
.PP
.I snmpget zeus zeusMS zeusAgent system.sysDescr.0
.PP
will retrieve the variable system.sysDescr.0:
.PP
.I system.sysDescr.0 =
"SunOS zeus.net.cmu.edu 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m"
.PP
If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an error
packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to pinpoint in what
way the request was malformed.  If there were other variables in the request,
the request will be resent without the bad variable.
.PP
Adding a "-d" to the argument list will cause the application to dump input and output packets.
.PP
Adding a "-q" to the argument list will cause the application to use a quicker, less verbose output form.
